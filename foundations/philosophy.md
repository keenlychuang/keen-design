# Philosophy

## Core Principles

Keen Design is about converging on the most simple and usable elements while maintaining identity. The system prioritizes readability, functionality, and timelessness.

### Design Keywords

- **Clean** - Uncluttered layouts with purposeful white space
- **Minimal** - Only essential elements, nothing superfluous
- **Functional** - Every design decision serves the content
- **Subtle accents** - Least possible intrusive callouts 
- **Timeless** - Classic choices that won't feel dated

### Simple and Clean

The foundation is deliberately understated - classic serif fonts, simple layouts, muted colors. This creates a calm, readable environment that does not need to be updated or iterated often. 

The "twist" comes through:
- **Dot motifs** (•) as navigation separators and accent elements
- **String/line connections** that subtly link related content
- **Geometric simplicity** in decorative touches

### Content-First Approach

Every design decision should ask: "Does this serve the content or the reader?"

- Typography optimized for long-form reading
- Generous white space for visual breathing room
- Clear hierarchy that guides the eye naturally
- Minimal cognitive load on navigation and interface elements

### Complexity is the Enemy

Keen Design focuses on:

- Classic typography utilizes most-adopted patterns
- Simple geometric shapes and patterns
- Restrained color palettes
- Functional layouts based on reading patterns

This approach ensures your content remains the focus and your site ages gracefully.

## Visual Motifs

### Dots (•)

- **Symbolism**: Simplicity, waypoints, connection points
- **Usage**: Navigation separators, callout markers, section dividers
- **Restraint**: Use sparingly for maximum impact
- **Character**: Basic, universal, unadorned

### Strings/Lines

- **Symbolism**: Connection, flow, structure
- **Usage**: Section dividers, navigation connectors, timeline elements
- **Style**: Simple, geometric, unobtrusive

### Geometric Elements

- **Approach**: Simple shapes and patterns
- **Purpose**: Subtle visual interest without distraction
- **Implementation**: Low opacity backgrounds, simple borders, clean typography symbols

### Symbol Guidelines

- **Prefer basic symbols**: •, ✓, !, ", - over emojis or complex icons
- **Universal readability**: Symbols should render consistently across all systems
- **Functional clarity**: Each symbol should have clear semantic meaning
- **Minimal variety**: Stick to a small set of essential symbols
